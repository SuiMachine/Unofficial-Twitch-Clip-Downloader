            It's important to note this event is fired on a CEF UI thread, which by default is not the same as your application UI
            thread. It is unwise to block on this thread for any length of time as your browser will become unresponsive and/or hang..
            To access UI elements you'll need to Invoke/Dispatch onto the UI Thread.
            (The exception to this is when your running with settings.MultiThreadedMessageLoop = false, then they'll be the same thread).
